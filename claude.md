**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025
**Session Focus:** Stripe Metadata Improvements & Payment Debugging

---

## üìå Current Status

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (Oct 28, 2025)

#### Stripe Metadata Improvements
**Objective:** Fix Stripe payment intent metadata to show proper transaction information in Stripe dashboard.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Description Field Format** ‚úÖ
   - Changed from showing question text to: `"Question #ID - QC"` or `"Question #ID - DD"`
   - QC = Quick Consult, DD = Deep Dive
   - Updated to use Stripe's native `description` field (not metadata)
   - Files: `api/lib/stripe.js`, `api/questions/quick-consult.js`, `api/questions/deep-dive.js`

2. **Customer Email in Payment Intents** ‚úÖ
   - Added `customerEmail` parameter to payment creation
   - Stored in Stripe's `receipt_email` field
   - Also stored in metadata as `customer_email` for searching
   - Files: `api/lib/stripe.js`, `api/payments/create-intent.js`

3. **Refund Date Tracking** ‚úÖ
   - Added `refund_date`, `refund_reason`, `refunded: "true"` to metadata
   - Stored when payment is canceled/refunded
   - Files: `api/questions/refund.js`

4. **Decline Reason Tracking** ‚úÖ
   - Added `decline_date`, `decline_reason`, `declined: "true"` to metadata
   - Stored when Deep Dive offer is declined
   - Files: `api/offers-decline.js`

5. **Metadata Cleanup** ‚úÖ
   - Removed redundant `description` from metadata (now using Stripe's native field)
   - Removed redundant `tier_type` from metadata (kept `question_type` only)
   - Files: `api/payments/create-intent.js`

**New Stripe Functions Added:**
- `updatePaymentIntent()` - Updates both description and metadata (not just metadata)

**Current Metadata Structure:**
```json
// At payment creation:
{
  "expert_handle": "gojko",
  "expert_profile_id": "139",
  "client_ip": "143.179.198.118",
  "created_at": "2025-10-28T15:40:56.313Z",
  "customer_email": "gojkop@gmail.com"
}

// After question creation:
{
  "question_id": "533",
  "question_type": "quick_consult",  // or "deep_dive"
  "question_title": "testing QC question stripe",
  "proposed_price_cents": "15000"  // Deep Dive only
}

// If refunded:
{
  "refund_date": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "refund_reason": "Expert declined",
  "refunded": "true"
}

// If declined:
{
  "decline_date": "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z",
  "decline_reason": "Price too low",
  "declined": "true"
}
```

#### Enhanced Debugging Logs
**Objective:** Add detailed logging to diagnose refund and payment capture issues.

**Issues Being Debugged:**
1. **Refund Authorization:** "Forbidden: You are not authorized to refund this question"
2. **Payment Capture:** Payments remaining in "uncaptured" state after answering

**Changes Made:**

1. **Refund Logging** (`api/questions/refund.js`) ‚úÖ
   - Added `[REFUND]` prefixed logs throughout ownership verification
   - Logs each step: user auth, question fetch, expert profile fetch, ownership check
   - Shows user IDs and expert profile IDs for debugging
   - Includes error status codes and stack traces

2. **Payment Capture Logging** (`api/answers/create.js`) ‚úÖ
   - Added `[CAPTURE]` prefixed logs throughout capture flow
   - Logs payment intent search results
   - Logs capture attempt and success/failure
   - Logs Xano payment table update
   - Shows payment intent status at each step

**Log Examples:**
```
üîç [REFUND] Verifying ownership for question 533...
‚úì [REFUND] Authenticated user ID: 123
‚úì [REFUND] Question expert_profile_id: 139
‚úì [REFUND] Expert user ID: 123
‚úÖ [REFUND] Ownership verified successfully

üí≥ [CAPTURE] Starting payment capture for question 533...
üí≥ [CAPTURE] Payment intent search result: { found: true, id: 'pi_xxx', status: 'requires_capture' }
üí≥ [CAPTURE] Capturing payment intent: pi_xxx
‚úÖ [CAPTURE] Payment captured successfully
```

#### Code Deployment Sync
**Objective:** Sync latest code from dev repo to deploy repo for Vercel deployment.

**Process:**
1. Identified changed files in last 2 commits:
   - `api/lib/stripe.js` - New `updatePaymentIntent()` function
   - `api/payments/create-intent.js` - Customer email + metadata cleanup
   - `api/questions/quick-consult.js` - Description update (QC)
   - `api/questions/deep-dive.js` - Description update (DD)
   - `api/questions/refund.js` - Enhanced logging
   - `api/offers-decline.js` - Decline metadata
   - `api/answers/create.js` - Enhanced logging

2. Copied files from dev to deploy:
   ```bash
   /Users/gojkop/QuickChat/quickchat-dev ‚Üí /Users/gojkop/QuickChat/quickchat-deploy
   ```

3. Committed and pushed to deploy repo:
   - Commit: `52b6876 fixing refund.`
   - Status: ‚úÖ Synced and deployed

**Files Synced:**
- ‚úÖ `api/answers/create.js` - Enhanced capture logging
- ‚úÖ `api/questions/refund.js` - Enhanced refund logging
- ‚úÖ `api/offers-decline.js` - Already synced

## üîç Issues to Debug (Next Session)

### 1. Refund Authorization Failure
**Symptom:** "Forbidden: You are not authorized to refund this question"

**Next Steps:**
1. Trigger refund in UI
2. Check Vercel logs for `[REFUND]` messages
3. Look for which step fails:
   - ‚ùå Failed to fetch user profile
   - ‚ùå Failed to fetch question details
   - ‚ùå Failed to fetch expert profile
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Ownership verification failed (user IDs don't match)

**Possible Causes:**
- Token not being passed correctly
- User ID mismatch between authenticated user and expert
- Expert profile relationship broken
- Xano endpoint permission issues

### 2. Payment Not Being Captured
**Symptom:** Payment remains in "uncaptured" state after answering question

**Next Steps:**
1. Submit an answer in UI
2. Check Vercel logs for `[CAPTURE]` messages
3. Look for:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è No payment intent found (metadata search failing)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Payment in unexpected status
   - ‚ùå Capture API call failing

**Possible Causes:**
- `findPaymentIntentByQuestionId()` not finding payment (metadata not stored correctly)
- Payment intent already in wrong state
- Stripe API call failing
- Background async task failing silently

## üìÅ Repository Structure

**Development Repo:** `/Users/gojkop/QuickChat/quickchat-dev`
- Work here for all code changes
- Commit changes to git
- NOT directly deployed to Vercel

**Deploy Repo:** `/Users/gojkop/QuickChat/quickchat-deploy`
- Sync changes from dev repo manually or via GitHub sync
- This repo is connected to Vercel
- Automatically deploys on push to main

**Sync Workflow:**
1. Make changes in `/quickchat-dev`
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. GitHub sync automatically updates `/quickchat-deploy`
4. OR manually copy files using `cp` or `rsync`
5. Commit and push from deploy repo
6. Vercel automatically deploys

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Changes Needed

**Customer Email in Payment Intent:**
The backend now accepts `customerEmail` parameter, but frontend needs to pass it.

**Location:** Check where `createPaymentIntent()` is called in:
- Payment flow components
- Question submission components

**Add:**
```javascript
await createPaymentIntent({
  amount,
  currency,
  description,
  metadata,
  captureMethod,
  expertHandle,
  tierType,
  customerEmail: payerEmail  // ADD THIS
});
```

---

## üìù Next Session Actions

1. **Test Refund Flow:**
   - Try to refund/decline a question
   - Check Vercel logs for `[REFUND]` messages
   - Identify which step is failing

2. **Test Payment Capture:**
   - Answer a question
   - Check Vercel logs for `[CAPTURE]` messages
   - Verify payment status changes to "succeeded" in Stripe

3. **Update Frontend:**
   - Add `customerEmail` to payment intent creation
   - Test that customer email shows in Stripe dashboard

4. **Verify Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Check that description shows: "Question #ID - QC/DD"
   - Check that metadata is clean (no `tier_type`, no `description`)
   - Check that customer email shows in payment details
