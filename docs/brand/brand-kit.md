--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Brand Summary

- One-liner: mindPick turns quick questions into paid, high-signal exchanges—no scheduling, no awkwardness.
- Elevator pitch (45s):
  Experts get asked for “quick brain-picks” every day. mindPick makes those asks fair and frictionless: share one personal link, and people can ask short, focused questions that you answer on your terms—async, fast, and paid. For askers, it’s the fastest path to expert insight; for experts, it’s value for value without the overhead of meetings. AI assists, but your judgment is the product.
- Boilerplate:
  mindPick is a lightweight monetization and delivery layer for expert insight. It replaces awkward favors and slow scheduling with paid, structured, asynchronous Q&A. Trusted by busy operators and domain experts who want to help more people, make better use of time, and keep the exchange fair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Brand Strategy

- Purpose (why we exist): Make expert knowledge accessible without exploiting expert time.
- Vision: The default way to “pick your brain” online—fair, fast, respected.
- Mission: Enable experts to monetize and scale high-signal advice through a simple link and structured async exchanges.

- Category: Expert monetization and async advice platform (SaaS, prosumer).
- Primary audiences:
  - Supply (Experts): operators, advisors, creators, PMs, designers, engineers, marketers, consultants, academics.
  - Demand (Askers): founders, job seekers, learners, career switchers, operators with specific tactical questions.

- Positioning Statement:
  For experts and operators asked for “quick advice,” mindPick is the frictionless link that turns brain-picks into paid, structured exchanges—faster than meetings and fairer than favors—because it combines instant intake, payments, and AI-assisted review into a single, modern flow.

- Differentiators:
  1) Frictionless flow: One link, paid, structured, async—no scheduling.
  2) Fair by design: “Value for value” replaces awkward favors.
  3) Expert-first control: Set price, scope, SLAs; answer on your terms.
  4) AI assists, humans lead: AI helps triage, coach, and summarize; expert judgment is the product.
  5) Trusted UX: clear expectations, transparent pricing, and high signal on both sides.

- Reasons to Believe (RTBs):
  - Instant personal link; integrated payments and receipts.
  - Structured prompts and AI coach to improve question quality.
  - Clear SLAs, reminders, and async delivery options (text, audio, video).

  - Receipts and donation options (social impact as a differentiator, if retained).

- Brand Attributes (personality):
  - Direct
  - Respectful
  - Expert-first
  - Modern
  - Trustworthy

- Core narrative:
  The internet made it easy to ask experts for favors but hard to keep exchanges fair. mindPick restores balance: a simple, respectful way to pay for focused insight, delivered fast. AI supports the exchange; experts still deliver the value.

4) Visual Identity

  - Primary: “mindPick” wordmark with gradient “Pick” spanning indigo→violet; subline optional.
  - Clear space: Min height = cap height of “m”; leave that margin on all sides.
  - Minimum size: digital width ≥ 120px; avoid gradient banding at small sizes; use solid color fallback (#111827 or #4F46E5).
  - Subline guidance: Prefer “Expert-led, AI‑assisted.” in marketing contexts. Omit subline at small sizes for clarity.

  - Tracking: tighten headings slightly (-1% to -2%) as in current logo/hero.

    - exit:     cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1)
  - Prefer crossfade and subtle scale; avoid bouncy overshoots in core flows.

- Layout & components:
  - Grid: 12-col, 72/80/96px max content widths, generous white space.
  - Radius tokens: 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 (match product UI).

- Do / Don’t:
  - Do respect clear space, maintain gradient direction, keep contrast.
  - Don’t skew or outline the logo; don’t overuse gradients on large text; avoid tinted text on tinted backgrounds without contrast checks.
