## 3. SOCIAL LISTENING & AUTO-ENGAGE AGENT

### Problem It Solves
Experts miss hundreds of opportunities daily where someone asks for help in their domain on social media. Manual monitoring is impossible at scale.

### Solution Overview
AI monitors social platforms for relevant conversations, evaluates fit, and posts helpful replies with expert's profile link - all autonomously.

### Functional Requirements

**Setup Phase:**
- Expert defines keywords and topics to monitor
- AI generates expanded keyword list using semantic understanding
- Expert sets engagement rules (confidence threshold, platforms, frequency)

**Monitoring Loop (runs every 15 minutes):**
1. Search social platforms for keyword mentions
2. Filter out irrelevant posts (spam, already answered, off-topic)
3. Analyze each relevant post for:
   - Genuine help request vs. rhetorical question
   - Fit with expert's specialization
   - Safety (avoid controversial topics)
   - Competition (already well-answered?)
4. Generate confidence score (0-100%)
5. For high-confidence matches (>70%):
   - Generate contextual, non-promotional reply
   - Include brief insight + profile link
   - Post reply with attribution tracking
6. Log engagement for performance analysis

- **Safety Score:** <1% of engagements flagged as inappropriate

---

## 4. CONVERSION PREDICTION ENGINE

### Problem It Solves
All profile visitors are treated equally, but behavioral signals indicate who's likely to convert. Without prediction, high-intent visitors leave without converting.

### Solution Overview
Machine learning model predicts conversion probability in real-time based on session behavior, then triggers appropriate interventions (discounts, email capture, testimonials).

### Functional Requirements

**Data Collection (Client-Side):**
- Track visitor behavior: scroll depth, time on page, video views, clicks
- Capture session metadata: referrer, device, location, time of day
- Monitor interaction patterns: questions viewed, testimonials read

**Prediction (Server-Side):**
1. Extract features from session data
2. Run through ML model to get conversion probability score
3. Classify visitor: High Intent (>70%), Medium Intent (40-70%), Low Intent (<40%)
4. Trigger appropriate intervention based on classification

**Interventions:**
- **High Intent:** Time-limited discount modal ("Book in 10 min → 15% off")
- **Medium Intent:** Email capture ("Get notified when expert is available")
- **Low Intent:** Social proof display (show best testimonials)

**Model Training:**
- Train on historical `campaign_visits` data with conversion outcomes
- Features: session duration, scroll depth, referrer type, device, time of day, questions viewed
- Retrain weekly with new data
- A/B test model versions before full deployment

**Output:**
- Real-time conversion probability score
- Triggered intervention (modal, email form, testimonials)
- Attribution tracking (did intervention lead to conversion?)

### Data Requirements

**New Database Tables:**
- `session_tracking`: Behavioral data per visitor session
- `ml_predictions`: Logged predictions for model evaluation
- `conversion_interventions`: Track which interventions were shown and outcomes

**ML Infrastructure:**
- Feature extraction pipeline
- Model training environment (Python/scikit-learn or TensorFlow)
- Model serving API (real-time inference)
- Model versioning and A/B testing framework

### Success Metrics
- **Model Accuracy:** 75%+ precision on conversion prediction
- **Intervention Impact:** 25%+ increase in conversion rate for high-intent visitors
- **False Positive Rate:** <10% (avoid annoying visitors with wrong interventions)
- **Model Latency:** <200ms for real-time prediction

## 5. DYNAMIC PRICING OPTIMIZER

### Problem It Solves
Experts struggle to find optimal pricing. Too high = low conversion. Too low = undervalued. Manual price testing is slow and loses revenue.

### Solution Overview
AI analyzes demand signals and competitive benchmarks to recommend optimal pricing, then runs automated A/B tests to validate.

### Functional Requirements

**Demand Signal Collection:**
- Profile visit volume and trends
- Conversion rate changes
- Average response time (supply constraint indicator)
- Current question backlog
- Expert rating and review sentiment
- Seasonal patterns

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Identify similar experts by specialization
- Track their pricing and conversion rates
- Calculate category median and percentiles

**Pricing Recommendation Logic:**
1. Collect 30-day demand signals
2. Compare to expert's historical performance
3. Benchmark against category averages
4. Apply pricing rules:
   - High demand (30+ visits/week) + fast response → +10-20% price
   - Low conversion (<2%) + high price → -15-25% price
   - High rating (4.8+) + high demand → premium pricing tier
   - Seasonal adjustment (holidays, industry events)
5. Generate recommendation with confidence score and reasoning

**A/B Testing Framework:**
- If recommended price differs >15% from current, create test
- Split traffic 50/50 between current and recommended price
- Run for 14 days or until statistical significance reached
- Auto-implement winning price or revert if no improvement

**Output:**
- Pricing recommendation with reasoning
- A/B test results and winner
- Revenue impact projection
- Notification to expert with recommendation

### Data Requirements

**New Database Tables:**
- `pricing_recommendations`: AI suggestions log
- `pricing_tests`: A/B test configurations and results
- `competitive_benchmarks`: Category pricing data

**Analytics Requirements:**
- Time-series demand forecasting

3. Score partners on fit (0-100 based on audience overlap, engagement rate, complementarity)
4. Select top 10 partners for outreach

**Outreach Automation:**
1. Generate personalized outreach email for each partner
2. Include specific compliment on their recent work (shows research)
3. Propose concrete partnership terms (referral fee, lead sharing)
4. Keep tone warm and collegial (not salesy)
5. Queue for expert approval before sending

**Partnership Management:**
1. Track referrals from each partner
2. Calculate revenue generated per partnership
3. Send automated monthly reports to partners
4. Flag underperforming partnerships for review

**Output:**
