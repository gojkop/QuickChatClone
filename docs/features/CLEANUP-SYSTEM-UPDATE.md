# Magic Link Token Cleanup - Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 16, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Tested
**Feature:** Automated cleanup of old magic_link_tokens

---

## Overview

Added automated cleanup for the `magic_link_tokens` table to the existing nightly cleanup cron job. Old tokens are now automatically deleted to keep the database clean while preserving recent tokens for security auditing.

---

## What Was Added

### Part 4: Magic Link Tokens Cleanup

The nightly cleanup cron job (`/api/cron/cleanup-orphaned-media.js`) now includes a fourth part that cleans up old magic link tokens based on these criteria:

| Token Type | Cleanup Rule | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Expired tokens** | Deleted after 7 days | Grace period for debugging |
| **Used tokens** | Deleted after 30 days | Keep recent for audit trail |
| **Unused tokens** | Deleted after 30 days | Clean up abandoned sign-in attempts |

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend Code
**File:** `/api/cron/cleanup-orphaned-media.js`

**Changes:**
- Added Part 4: Magic Link Tokens cleanup (lines 631-714)
- Updated summary totals to include token counts
- Updated response JSON to include `magicLinkTokens` section
- Updated error notification to include token errors
- Updated success message to include token count

**New Functionality:**
```javascript
// Part 4: Clean up old magic_link_tokens
- Fetches all tokens from database
- Calculates cutoff dates (7 days, 30 days)
- Iterates through tokens and determines if they should be deleted
- Deletes via Xano DELETE /internal/magic-link-token endpoint
- Tracks deleted/skipped/error counts
- Logs detailed information about each deletion
```

### 2. Xano Endpoints

**Created/Updated in Xano Public API:**

#### GET /internal/media (Updated)
**Added to response:**
```json
{
  "magic_link_tokens": [...]  // All magic_link_tokens records
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Added query: `all_magic_link_tokens` ‚Üí Query all records from `magic_link_tokens` table
- Updated return statement to include `magic_link_tokens: all_magic_link_tokens`

#### DELETE /internal/magic-link-token (New)
**Purpose:** Delete a single magic link token by ID

**Inputs:**
- `x_api_key` (query parameter, text) - Internal API key for authentication
- `token_id` (query parameter, integer) - ID of token to delete

**Function Stack:**
1. Authenticate with `x_api_key`
2. Delete from `magic_link_tokens` table where `id = token_id`
3. Return `{ success: true }`

---

## Testing Results

### Test Setup
Created 3 test tokens manually in Xano with old dates:
1. Expired token (8 days old)
2. Used token (30 days old)
3. Unused token (30 days old)

**Note:** Tokens were created directly in the Xano `magic_link_tokens` table with timestamps set to past dates to simulate old tokens.

### Test Execution
```bash
curl -X POST "https://quickchat-dev.vercel.app/api/cron/cleanup-orphaned-media" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

### Test Results
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "magicLinkTokens": {
    "deleted": 3,
    "errors": 0
  },
  "totals": {
    "deleted": 3,
    "errors": 0
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **All 3 test tokens successfully deleted with zero errors**

---

## Deployment

### Xano Changes (Required)
1. ‚úÖ Updated GET /internal/media endpoint
2. ‚úÖ Created DELETE /internal/magic-link-token endpoint

### Code Changes (Deployed)
1. ‚úÖ Modified `/api/cron/cleanup-orphaned-media.js`
2. ‚úÖ Updated `/docs/xano-internal-endpoints.md`
3. ‚úÖ Updated `/docs/CLAUDE.md`
4. ‚úÖ Updated `/docs/magic-link-authentication-guide.md`

### Verification
1. ‚úÖ Manual test executed successfully
2. ‚úÖ 3 test tokens cleaned up correctly
3. ‚úÖ No errors in execution
4. ‚úÖ Proper logging and reporting

---

## Monitoring

### Vercel Logs
The cleanup script logs detailed information for each run:

```
üîê PART 4: Cleaning up old magic link tokens...
Cutoff dates:
  - Expired tokens: older than 2025-01-09T...
  - Used tokens: older than 2024-12-17T...
  - Unused tokens: older than 2024-12-17T...

Deleting token 123 (expired_old): email=test@example.com, created=...
‚úÖ Deleted token 123

Part 4 complete: { total: X, deleted: X, skipped: X, errors: 0 }
```

### Automated Execution
- **Schedule:** Daily at 3:00 AM UTC (configured in `vercel.json`)
- **Monitoring:** Check Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí cleanup-orphaned-media
- **Notifications:** Email sent to admin if error rate exceeds 50%

---

## Benefits

1. **Automated Maintenance:** No manual token cleanup required
2. **Database Performance:** Keeps `magic_link_tokens` table size manageable
3. **Security:** Removes old tokens that could be exploited
4. **Debugging Support:** 7-day grace period allows investigation of issues
5. **Audit Trail:** 30-day retention of used tokens for security review
6. **Unified System:** Integrated with existing cleanup infrastructure

---

## Future Considerations

### Metrics to Track (Optional)
- Average tokens created per day
- Average tokens deleted per cleanup run
- Table size over time
- Cleanup execution time

### Potential Optimizations
- Adjust grace periods based on usage patterns
- Add token age analytics
- Alert if unusually high deletion counts

## Support

For issues with the cleanup system:

1. **Check Vercel Logs:** Look for Part 4 execution details
2. **Check Xano Table:** Query `magic_link_tokens` to see current state
3. **Manual Trigger:** Use the test script `./test-cleanup.sh`
4. **Verify Endpoints:** Test Xano endpoints directly
