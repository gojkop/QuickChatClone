<AnswerRecorder
  question={question}
  onReady={handleRecorderReady}    // Gets answer data
  onCancel={handleRecorderCancel}  // Cancel recording
/>
```

### AnswerRecorder → AnswerReviewModal
```javascript
// AnswerRecorder calls onReady with:
{
  text: "written answer",
  recordingSegments: [...], // Already uploaded segments
  attachments: [...],       // Already uploaded files
  recordingMode: 'multi-segment',
  recordingDuration: 123
}
```

### Data Flow
```
AnswerRecorder
  ├─ Progressive upload as recording happens
  ├─ useRecordingSegmentUpload (segments)
  ├─ useAttachmentUpload (files)
  └─ Passes uploaded references to onReady()
      ↓
AnswerReviewModal
  ├─ Shows summary of all content
  ├─ No additional uploads needed!
  └─ Just creates DB record with references
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "User ID is required" error
- ✅ **Fixed** - userId now passed from dashboard → modal → review

### Segments not uploading
- Check: `useRecordingSegmentUpload` is working
- Check: Network tab shows upload requests
- Check: No CORS errors

### Questions not refreshing
- Check: `handleAnswerSubmitted` callback is called
- Check: API returns updated question list
- Verify: Console shows "Questions refreshed"

### Modal not closing after submit
- Check: `onAnswerSubmitted` prop is passed
- Check: No errors in console during submission
- Verify: `onClose()` is called

## 📝 Important Notes

### Your AnswerRecorder is Already Perfect!
- Already handles progressive uploads ✅
- Already shows upload progress ✅
- Already has retry logic ✅
- **No changes needed!** ✅

### What Was Updated
1. **QuestionDetailModal** - Now uses AnswerRecorder (not AnswerComposer)
2. **ExpertDashboardPage** - Passes userId and refresh callback
3. **That's it!** Everything else works as-is

### Progressive Upload Flow
Your AnswerRecorder already:
1. Uploads each segment immediately after recording
2. Shows upload status for each segment
3. Disables "Review Answer" until all uploads complete
4. Passes upload references (not blobs) to review modal

## 🚀 Quick Implementation

1. **Update** `QuestionDetailModal.jsx` (copy from artifact)
2. **Update** `ExpertDashboardPage.jsx` (copy from earlier)
3. **No changes** to `AnswerRecorder.jsx` - it's perfect!
4. **Test** the complete flow

**Everything is ready!** Your existing AnswerRecorder is already production-ready with all the features. We just needed to wire it into the modal flow. 🎉

**TL;DR:** 
- ✅ Update 2 files (QuestionDetailModal + Dashboard)
- ✅ Your AnswerRecorder already does everything
- ✅ Test and deploy!
