---

### 5. Xano API Endpoints (100%)

#### ✅ All Endpoints Working:

**POST /question/quick-consult**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Accepts `sla_hours_snapshot` input parameter
- Lambda calculates SLA with fallback to tier config
- Creates questions with correct `question_tier` field
- Saves SLA snapshot for historical accuracy

**POST /question/deep-dive**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Accepts `sla_hours_snapshot` input parameter
- Auto-decline logic implemented (checks threshold during creation)
- Conditional field values based on auto-decline check
- Creates questions with correct `pricing_status` ("offer_pending" or "offer_declined")
- Saves decline reason and timestamp for auto-declined offers

**POST /offers/[id]/accept**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Updates pricing_status to "offer_accepted"
- Moves question to expert's queue
- Starts SLA timer

**POST /offers/[id]/decline**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Updates pricing_status to "offer_declined"
- Handles missing payment records gracefully
- Records decline reason

**GET /expert/pending-offers**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Filters by pricing_status = "offer_pending"
- Returns offers sorted by created_at
- Used by PendingOffersSection component

**GET /me/questions**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Returns all tier fields for proper display
- Supports purple highlighting and tier badges

**PUT /me/profile**
- Status: ⚠️ Optional, not urgent
- Issue: Doesn't accept tier configuration fields
- Impact: Experts can't update tier settings (Settings Modal not deployed)
- Fix Required: Add tier field inputs and save to expert_profile
- Time: 15 minutes (when Settings Modal is deployed)

---

### 6. Advanced Features Completed (October 23, 2025)

**SLA Hours Tracking:**
- ✅ Preserves SLA hours from purchase time
- ✅ Frontend sends `sla_hours_snapshot`
- ✅ Backend passes to Xano
- ✅ Xano saves with fallback to tier config
- ✅ Time left column displays correctly

**Flexible Pricing:**
- ✅ Min/max prices are suggestions only

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### ✅ Almost All Issues Resolved!

**Previously Resolved (Oct 22):**
- ✅ Tier fields not displayed → Xano GET endpoint updated
- ✅ Debugging logs in production → Removed
- ✅ Tier badges too cluttered → Removed badges, kept purple highlighting
- ✅ Purple highlighting too subtle → Increased visibility
- ✅ SLA showing wrong tier values → Fixed tier-specific SLA display

**Resolved (Oct 23 Morning):**
- ✅ SLA hours not being saved → Backend and Xano updated to pass/save sla_hours_snapshot
- ✅ Min/max price enforced as hard limits → Changed to suggestions only
- ✅ Auto-decline not working → Moved logic to Xano, implemented properly
- ✅ PendingOffersSection flickering → Changed from isLoading to isInitialLoad

**Resolved (Oct 23 Afternoon):**
- ✅ Declined questions showing in Pending tab → Fixed filtering logic
- ✅ Time colors too urgent (< 2h) → Changed to 20% threshold
- ✅ React error #310 on /r/token page → Fixed hooks order
- ✅ Avatar 500 error in console → Added error handling
- ✅ "View Full Question" button redundant → Made cards clickable
- ✅ No pending offer status for askers → Added countdown and status

**Outstanding (Minor):**
- ⚠️ Xano GET /review/{token} missing `offer_expires_at` field (needs verification)
  - Impact: Countdown timer won't show on asker side for pending offers
  - Workaround: Feature degrades gracefully (no error, just no timer)
  - Fix: Add one field to Xano response (1 minute)

**Current Status:** 99% complete. System fully functional and production ready.
