  - Sends offer notification to expert
  - Sends submission confirmation to asker
  - Returns review token

**Offer Management:**
- ✅ `POST /api/offers/[id]/accept` - Expert accepts offer
  - Proxies to Xano endpoint
  - Error handling
- ✅ `POST /api/offers/[id]/decline` - Expert declines offer
  - Proxies to Xano endpoint
  - Enhanced error logging
  - Graceful failure handling

**Legacy Support:**

---

### 5. Xano API Endpoints (100%)

#### ✅ All Endpoints Working:

**POST /question/quick-consult**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Accepts `sla_hours_snapshot` input parameter
- Lambda calculates SLA with fallback to tier config
- Creates questions with correct `question_tier` field
- Saves SLA snapshot for historical accuracy

**POST /question/deep-dive**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Accepts `sla_hours_snapshot` input parameter
- Auto-decline logic implemented (checks threshold during creation)
- Conditional field values based on auto-decline check
- Creates questions with correct `pricing_status` ("offer_pending" or "offer_declined")
- Saves decline reason and timestamp for auto-declined offers

**POST /offers/[id]/accept**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Updates pricing_status to "offer_accepted"
- Moves question to expert's queue
- Starts SLA timer

**POST /offers/[id]/decline**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Updates pricing_status to "offer_declined"
- Handles missing payment records gracefully
- Records decline reason

**GET /expert/pending-offers**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Filters by pricing_status = "offer_pending"
- Returns offers sorted by created_at
- Used by PendingOffersSection component

**GET /me/questions**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- Returns all tier fields for proper display
- Supports purple highlighting and tier badges

**PUT /me/profile**
- Status: ⚠️ Optional, not urgent
- Issue: Doesn't accept tier configuration fields
- Impact: Experts can't update tier settings (Settings Modal not deployed)
- Fix Required: Add tier field inputs and save to expert_profile
- Time: 15 minutes (when Settings Modal is deployed)

### 6. Advanced Features Completed (October 23, 2025)

**Auto-Decline:**
- ✅ Automatic rejection of low offers

**SLA Hours Tracking:**
- ✅ Preserves SLA hours from purchase time
- ✅ Frontend sends `sla_hours_snapshot`
- ✅ Backend passes to Xano
- ✅ Xano saves with fallback to tier config
- ✅ Time left column displays correctly

**Flexible Pricing:**
- ✅ Min/max prices are suggestions only
