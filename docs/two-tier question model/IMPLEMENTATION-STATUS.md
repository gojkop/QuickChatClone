## 🟡 PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### 5. Xano API Endpoints (60%)

#### ✅ Working Endpoints:

**POST /offers/[id]/accept**
- Status: ✅ Configured and tested

- Moves question to expert's queue

**POST /offers/[id]/decline**
- Status: ✅ Configured and tested
- Updates pricing_status to "offer_declined"
- Handles missing payment records gracefully

**GET /expert/pending-offers**
- Status: ✅ Configured
- Filters by pricing_status = "offer_pending"
- Returns offers sorted by created_at

#### ⚠️ Needs Update:

**POST /question/quick-consult**
- Status: ⚠️ Partially working

- Time: 5 minutes

**POST /question/deep-dive**
- Status: ⚠️ Partially working
- Issue: Creates questions but doesn't set tier/pricing fields
- Impact: No badges, no pending offers panel, no purple highlighting
- Fix Required: Add `question_tier`, `pricing_status`, `proposed_price_cents` in Add Record step
- Time: 5 minutes

**GET /me/questions**
- Status: ⚠️ Missing fields in response
- Issue: Doesn't return tier fields even though they exist in DB
- Impact: Frontend can't display badges or highlighting
- Fix Required: Update Lambda/Response to include tier fields
- Time: 10 minutes

**PUT /me/profile**
- Status: ⚠️ Optional, not urgent
- Issue: Doesn't accept tier configuration fields
- Impact: Experts can't update tier settings (Settings Modal not deployed)
