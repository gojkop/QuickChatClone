## üî¨ Detailed Verification (Optional)

### Create Test Endpoint in Xano

If you want to run validation queries:

**Create endpoint:** `GET /test/verify-migrations`

**Function Stack:**

```
Step 1: Query expert_profile
  - Get All Records
  - return as: all_experts

Step 2: Query question
  - Get All Records
  - return as: all_questions

Step 3: Query payment
  - Get All Records
  - return as: all_payments

Step 4: Response
  - expert_count = all_experts.length
  - question_count = all_questions.length
  - payment_count = all_payments.length
  - sample_expert = all_experts[0]
  - sample_question = all_questions[0]
  - sample_payment = all_payments[0]
```

**Call endpoint** and review the response to verify data looks correct.
