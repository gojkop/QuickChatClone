# Two-Tier System Implementation - Session Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

This session focused on fixing critical issues with the two-tier pricing system and completing the auto-decline functionality for Deep Dive offers.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SLA Hours Snapshot Not Being Saved ✅

**Problem:**
- Time left column in expert dashboard was empty for all new questions
- `sla_hours_snapshot` was being sent from frontend but not saved in Xano database

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend correctly sent `sla_hours_snapshot` in payload
- Vercel endpoints (quick-consult.js, deep-dive.js) were NOT passing it to Xano
- Xano endpoints were NOT accepting it as input parameter

**Solution:**

**Backend Changes:**
- `api/questions/quick-consult.js` - Added `sla_hours_snapshot` to Xano payload (line 60)
- `api/questions/deep-dive.js` - Added `sla_hours_snapshot` to Xano payload (line 70)

**Xano Changes:**
- POST `/question/quick-consult`:
  - Added input parameter: `sla_hours_snapshot` (Integer, optional)
  - Added Lambda step: `return sla_hours_snapshot || tier1_config.sla_hours;`
  - Updated Add Record to use Lambda result

- POST `/question/deep-dive`:
  - Added input parameter: `sla_hours_snapshot` (Integer, optional)
  - Added Lambda step: `return sla_hours_snapshot || expert_profile.tier2_sla_hours;`
  - Updated Add Record to use Lambda result

**Why This Matters:**
- Preserves the SLA hours shown to customer at purchase time
- Even if expert changes tier settings later, historical questions show correct SLA
- Time left column now displays correctly in dashboard

**Documentation:** `XANO-SLA-HOURS-SNAPSHOT-FIX.md`

### 2. Min/Max Price Validation Removed ✅

**Problem:**
- Users couldn't submit Deep Dive offers outside suggested price range
- Min/max were enforced as hard limits instead of suggestions
- Only auto-decline threshold should be enforced

**Solution:**

**Code Changes:**
- `src/pages/AskQuestionPage.jsx` (lines 117-126):
  - Removed min/max price validation
  - Only validates positive number
  - Added comments explaining min/max are suggestions

**UI Text Changes:**
- `src/pages/AskQuestionPage.jsx`:
  - Changed "Price Range:" to "Suggested Range:" (line 401)
  - Removed HTML `min` and `max` input attributes (lines 445-446)
  - Kept helper text showing suggested range

- `src/components/pricing/TierSelector.jsx`:
  - Added "Suggested range" label to Deep Dive pricing display (line 140)

**Behavior:**
- Users can submit ANY positive offer amount
- Offers below auto-decline threshold → automatically declined
- Offers above auto-decline threshold → go to expert for review (regardless of min/max)
- Min/max shown as guidance only

**Documentation:** `PRICING-VALIDATION-UPDATE.md`

### 3. Auto-Decline Implementation Completed ✅

**Problem:**
- Auto-decline logic was in frontend after question creation
- Frontend called `/api/offers/{id}/decline` which requires authentication
- Question submission is public (no auth token)
- Auto-decline failed with 401 error
- Questions stayed as `offer_pending` instead of being declined

**Solution:**
Moved auto-decline logic to Xano (during question creation, not after)

**Frontend Changes:**
- `src/pages/AskQuestionPage.jsx` (lines 208-209):
  - Removed broken frontend auto-decline code
  - Added comment explaining auto-decline happens in Xano

**Xano Implementation:**

Added to POST `/question/deep-dive`:

**Step 3: Check Auto-Decline Threshold (Lambda)**
```javascript
var autoDeclineThreshold = $var.expert_profile.tier2_auto_decline_below_cents;
var proposedPrice = proposed_price_cents; // Note: No $var. prefix for inputs

if (autoDeclineThreshold && proposedPrice < autoDeclineThreshold) {
  return {
    should_auto_decline: true,
    decline_reason: "Offer below minimum threshold of $" + (autoDeclineThreshold / 100)
  };
}

return {
  should_auto_decline: false,
  decline_reason: null
};
```
**Return as:** `auto_decline_check`

**Steps 4A-C: Calculate Conditional Values (3 Lambda steps)**

Step 4A - pricing_status:
```javascript
return $var.auto_decline_check.should_auto_decline ? "offer_declined" : "offer_pending";
```
**Return as:** `pricing_status_value`

Step 4B - status:
```javascript
return $var.auto_decline_check.should_auto_decline ? "declined" : "paid";
```
**Return as:** `status_value`

Step 4C - declined_at:
```javascript
return $var.auto_decline_check.should_auto_decline ? Date.now() : null;
```
**Return as:** `declined_at_value`

**Step 7: Updated Add Record Step**
- `pricing_status` = `pricing_status_value` (variable, not literal)
- `status` = `status_value` (variable, not literal)
- `decline_reason` = `auto_decline_check.decline_reason`
- `declined_at` = `declined_at_value` (variable)

**Step 9: Updated Response Step**
- Changed `status` from literal `"offer_pending"` to `$var.pricing_status_value`

**Key Learning:**
- Xano Lambda inputs accessed WITHOUT `$var.` prefix: `proposed_price_cents`
- Variables from previous steps accessed WITH `$var.` prefix: `$var.expert_profile`

**Behavior:**
- Offer below threshold ($30, threshold $50) → Created as `offer_declined`, never shown to expert
- Offer above threshold ($70, threshold $50) → Created as `offer_pending`, shown in PendingOffersSection
- No threshold set → All offers go to expert for review

**Documentation:** `AUTO-DECLINE-XANO-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### 4. PendingOffersSection Flickering Fixed ✅

**Problem:**
- Panel disappeared and reappeared every 30 seconds during background polling
- Caused question table to jump up and down
- Poor user experience

**Root Cause:**
- Background refresh set `isLoading = true`
- Component hid when `isLoading` was true
- Panel disappeared every 30 seconds

**Solution:**
Changed from `isLoading` to `isInitialLoad` state

**Code Changes:**
`src/components/dashboard/PendingOffersSection.jsx`:

- Line 30: Changed `isLoading` to `isInitialLoad`
- Line 50: Only set `isInitialLoad = false` after first load (not on every refresh)
- Lines 64-72: Updated visibility logic to use `isInitialLoad`
- Lines 141-157: Conditional rendering only hides during initial load

**Behavior:**
- **Initial load:** Panel hidden until data loads, then fades in smoothly
- **Background refresh (every 30s):** Panel stays visible, data updates silently
- **Last offer accepted/declined:** Panel fades out smoothly
- **No layout shifts or flickering**

---

## Testing Completed

### SLA Hours Snapshot
- ✅ Quick Consult questions now save `sla_hours_snapshot`
- ✅ Deep Dive questions now save `sla_hours_snapshot`
- ✅ Time left column displays correctly in dashboard

### Auto-Decline
- ✅ Offer below threshold ($30 < $50) → Auto-declined, `pricing_status = 'offer_declined'`
- ✅ Offer above threshold ($70 > $50) → Pending, `pricing_status = 'offer_pending'`
- ✅ No threshold set → All offers go to expert
- ✅ Auto-declined offers don't appear in PendingOffersSection
- ✅ Auto-declined offers filtered out of main question list

### Panel Stability
- ✅ Panel doesn't flicker during 30-second polling
- ✅ Panel stays visible during background refresh
- ✅ No layout shifts in question table

## Key Learnings

### Xano Lambda Variable Access
- **Inputs:** Access without `$var.` prefix
  - ✅ `proposed_price_cents`
  - ✅ `expert_profile_id`
  - ❌ `$var.proposed_price_cents`

- **Previous step variables:** Access with `$var.` prefix
  - ✅ `$var.expert_profile`
  - ✅ `$var.auto_decline_check`
  - ❌ `expert_profile`

### Auto-Decline Best Practice
- ✅ Implement during question creation (atomic operation)
- ❌ Don't implement after creation (requires auth, error-prone)

### UI State Management
- Use separate flags for initial load vs background refresh
- Keep UI stable during background operations
- Only hide/show on meaningful state changes

---

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [x] Test SLA hours snapshot saves correctly
- [x] Test auto-decline with offers below threshold
- [x] Test auto-decline with offers above threshold
- [x] Test auto-decline when threshold not set
- [x] Test panel doesn't flicker during background refresh
- [x] Test panel hides when last offer accepted/declined
- [x] Verify time left column shows correctly in dashboard
- [x] Verify declined offers don't appear in pending section
- [x] Update documentation

**Ready for deployment:** ✅ Yes

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Deploy to Vercel (frontend changes)
2. Monitor auto-decline behavior in production
3. Check for any edge cases with SLA tracking

### Future Enhancements
1. Add email notification when offers are auto-declined
2. Add analytics for auto-decline rates
3. Show auto-declined offers in a separate "Declined" section (optional)
4. Add expert preference to enable/disable auto-decline notifications
