## üîß Implementation Notes

### **Key Technical Decisions**

1. **Lambda Functions Everywhere**
   - Used `$var.` prefix for all variable access
   - Replaced `??` operator with `||` (Xano doesn't support nullish coalescing)
   - Always return objects from validation Lambdas (never null) to avoid "Cannot read properties" errors

2. **Timestamp Handling**
   - Used `|to_timestamp` expression for current timestamps
   - Used `Date.now()` in Lambda functions for calculations
   - All timestamps stored as Unix milliseconds

3. **Validation Pattern**
   - Separate Lambda steps for each validation
   - Throw errors for validation failures
   - Use If/Else for conditional logic (e.g., auto-decline)

4. **Database Records**
   - Always create both `question` and `payment` records
   - Maintain legacy fields (`price_cents`, `sla_hours`, `status`) for backward compatibility
   - Use new tier fields (`question_tier`, `pricing_status`, etc.) for new logic

5. **Privacy & Security**
   - Public profile endpoint does NOT expose `tier2_auto_decline_below_cents`
   - All expert endpoints require authentication
   - Question submission endpoints are public (no auth)

## üìä Database State After Testing

### Questions Created:
- **ID 186:** Quick Consult (paid)
- **ID 187:** Deep Dive (offer_declined)
- **ID 188:** Deep Dive (offer_accepted)

### Payment Records Created:
- **Question 186:** status = "authorized", question_type = "quick_consult"
- **Question 187:** status = "refunded", question_type = "deep_dive"
- **Question 188:** status = "accepted", question_type = "deep_dive"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Next Steps

### **Missing Functionality (To Be Implemented):**

1. **Stripe Integration**
   - Payment authorization (pre-auth/hold)
   - Payment capture (when answer submitted)
   - Payment cancellation/refund (when offer declined)
   - Webhook handling for payment events

2. **Cron Jobs**
   - `/api/cron/expire-offers.js` - Auto-expire offers after 24h
   - `/api/cron/enforce-sla.js` - Extend for tier support
   - `/api/cron/retry-captures.js` - Retry failed captures

3. **Email Notifications**
   - 7 ZeptoMail templates needed:
     - offer_submitted
     - offer_received
     - offer_accepted
     - offer_declined
     - offer_expired
     - quick_consult_submitted
     - payment_captured

4. **Frontend Components**
   - PublicProfilePage - tier selection UI
   - PaymentScreen - Stripe Elements
   - QuestionComposer - tier-specific flows
   - ExpertSettings - pricing configuration
   - PendingOffersSection - offer management
   - QuestionTable - tier indicators (‚ö° Quick vs üéØ Deep Dive)
   - QuestionStatusPage - tracking for askers

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### **Priority 1: Stripe Integration**

The payment flow is partially implemented - we're creating payment records but not actually processing payments with Stripe.

**Required:**
1. Create Stripe payment authorization endpoint (pre-auth)
2. Integrate authorization into question submission endpoints
3. Implement capture logic (triggered when expert submits answer)
4. Implement refund/cancel logic (triggered on decline/expire)

**Reference:** Implementation spec at `/docs/two-tier question model/implementation-specificaiton.md`

### **Priority 2: Frontend Integration**

Build UI components to consume these APIs.

**Start with:**
1. Update PublicProfilePage to show tier options
2. Integrate tier selection into question submission flow
3. Build expert settings for configuring tiers
4. Build pending offers dashboard section

### **Priority 3: Background Jobs**

Implement cron jobs for automated workflows.

**Required:**
1. Offer expiration (24-hour timeout)
2. SLA enforcement (auto-refund on missed SLA)
3. Payment capture retry (handle transient failures)
