## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Dashboard Tab Filtering Logic

**Issue:** Questions weren't being filtered correctly across the three tabs (Pending, Answered, All).

**Solution:** Updated filtering logic in `ExpertDashboardPage.jsx` (lines 246-273, 275-302)

**New Behavior:**

#### **Pending Tab**
Shows only:
- ✅ Unanswered questions (`status === 'paid' && !answered_at`)
- ✅ Non-declined questions (`pricing_status !== 'offer_declined'`)
- ✅ Non-hidden questions (`hidden !== true`)
- ❌ Excludes pending offers (they stay in PendingOffersSection)

#### **Answered Tab**
Shows only:
- ✅ Completed questions (`status === 'closed' || status === 'answered' || answered_at`)

#### **All Tab**
Shows everything:
- ✅ Declined questions
- ✅ Auto-declined questions
- ✅ Expired questions
- ✅ Hidden questions (if "Show Hidden" toggle enabled)
- ❌ Still excludes pending offers (only in PendingOffersSection)

**Count Badges:**
- Pending (X) - Counts only actionable questions
- Answered (X) - Counts completed questions
- All (X) - Counts everything except pending offers

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/pages/ExpertDashboardPage.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

---

### 2. Clickable Pending Offer Cards

**Issue:** Users had to click a specific "View Full Question" button. Wanted entire card to be clickable like QuestionTable rows.

**Solution:** Restructured `PendingOffersSection.jsx` to make cards clickable.

**Changes:**
1. **Made card clickable** (lines 190-237)
   - Click anywhere on card → Opens QuestionDetailModal
   - Added hover effects (border color change)
   - Added subtle hint text: "Click to view full question details"

2. **Moved buttons outside clickable area** (lines 240-277)
   - Accept and Decline buttons use `stopPropagation()`
   - Prevents modal from opening when clicking buttons

3. **Removed "View Full Question" button**
   - Cleaner, more intuitive UX
   - Matches QuestionTable interaction pattern

**UX Flow:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Clickable card area]              │  ← Click to view details
│                                     │
│  Question Title                    │
│  Offered: $70 • Expires in 23h 45m │
│                                     │
│  Message: "Need urgent help..."    │
│  Question: "How do I..."           │
│                                     │
│  Click to view full question       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
│ [Accept] [Decline]                 │  ← Buttons don't open modal
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/dashboard/PendingOffersSection.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

---

### 3. Time Urgency Color Threshold (20% Rule)

**Issue:** Time remaining showed red too early (< 2 hours), causing unnecessary urgency.

**Solution:** Implemented 20% threshold logic for both pending offers and question SLA.

**Logic:**
- **Normal color:** More than 20% time remaining
- **Red color:** Less than 20% time remaining OR expired/overdue

**Examples:**

| Total Duration | 20% Threshold | Color Changes At |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| 24 hours      | 4.8 hours     | < 4.8h = Red     |
| 48 hours      | 9.6 hours     | < 9.6h = Red     |
| 72 hours      | 14.4 hours    | < 14.4h = Red    |

**Implementation:**

#### **PendingOffersSection.jsx** (lines 28-47)
```javascript
const getTimeRemainingColor = (expiresAt, createdAt) => {
  const totalDuration = expiry - created;
  const remaining = expiry - now;
  const percentRemaining = (remaining / totalDuration) * 100;

  if (percentRemaining < 20) {
    return 'text-red-600'; // Urgent
  }
  return 'text-orange-600'; // Normal
};
```

#### **QuestionTable.jsx** (lines 65-92)
```javascript
const formatSLA = (slaHours, createdAt) => {
  const percentRemaining = (remaining / slaSeconds) * 100;
  const isUrgent = percentRemaining < 20;

  return <span className={isUrgent ? 'text-red-600 font-bold' : ''}>
    {timeDisplay}
  </span>;
};
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Less alarm fatigue
- ✅ More meaningful urgency signals
- ✅ Consistent across all time displays

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/dashboard/PendingOffersSection.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboard/QuestionTable.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

---

### 4. Asker Side - Pending Offer Status

**Issue:** When askers submitted Deep Dive offers, they only saw generic "Answer In Progress" - no indication that expert was still reviewing the offer.

**Solution:** Added dedicated "Awaiting Expert Review" status with countdown timer.

**Implementation:** Updated `AnswerReviewPage.jsx` (lines 762-786)

**New Status Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   [Purple clipboard icon]          │
│                                     │
│  Awaiting Expert Review            │
│                                     │
│  {ExpertName} is reviewing your    │
│  Deep Dive offer.                  │
│                                     │
│  Expert will respond within 23h 45m│
│                                     │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ You'll receive an email       │ │
│  │ notification once the expert  │ │
│  │ accepts or declines your      │ │
│  │ offer.                        │ │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Three States:**

1. **Pending Offer** (`pricing_status === 'offer_pending'`)
   - Purple theme
   - Countdown to offer expiration
   - Email notification reminder

2. **Answer In Progress** (`pricing_status === 'offer_accepted'` or null)
   - Amber theme
   - SLA countdown
   - Expert is working on answer

3. **Declined** (`pricing_status === 'offer_declined'`)
   - Red/orange theme
   - Decline reason displayed
   - No "Answer In Progress" section

**Helper Function Added:**
```javascript
const formatOfferTimeRemaining = (expiresAt) => {
  // Returns format like "23h 45m" or "45m"
  // Handles expired offers
};
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/pages/AnswerReviewPage.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and working

---

### 5. Declined Offer Visibility & Messaging

**Issue:** Declined questions were showing in expert's Pending tab, and askers saw broken links.

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### **A) Expert Dashboard Filtering**
- ✅ Declined questions filtered out of Pending tab
- ✅ Declined questions visible in All tab
- ✅ Expert sees declined banner when opening question
- ✅ "Answer This Question" button hidden for declined offers

**Implementation:** `ExpertDashboardPage.jsx`
```javascript
if (activeTab === 'pending') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(q => {
    const isDeclined = q.pricing_status === 'offer_declined' || q.status === 'declined';
    return !isDeclined;
  });
}
```

#### **B) Asker Side Messaging**
- ✅ Declined banner shows with reason
- ✅ "Answer In Progress" hidden for declined offers
- ✅ Action buttons: "Back to Expert Profile" and "Go to Homepage"

**Previously Implemented (Oct 23 AM):**
- `QuestionDetailModal.jsx` - Expert side declined banner
- `AnswerReviewPage.jsx` - Asker side declined banner

**Status:** ✅ Complete and working

---

### 6. Avatar Image Error Handling (500 Error Fix)

**Issue:** Console showed 500 error when expert's avatar image failed to load.

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 () (214, line 0)
```

**Root Cause:** React hooks violation - `avatarError` state declared after conditional logic.

**Solution:** Moved `useState(false)` to top of component.

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
function AnswerReviewPage() {
  // ... other code ...
  const expertAvatar = data.expert_profile?.avatar_url;

  const [avatarError, setAvatarError] = useState(false); // ❌ WRONG LOCATION

  return ( ... );
}
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
function AnswerReviewPage() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [avatarError, setAvatarError] = useState(false); // ✅ TOP OF COMPONENT

  // ... rest of code ...
}
```

**React Error:** #310 (Hooks called in wrong order)

**Additional Fix:** Added `onError` handler to avatar images:
```jsx
<img
  src={expertAvatar}
  onError={() => setAvatarError(true)}
  className="..."
/>
```

**Fallback Display:** Shows expert's first initial in gradient circle if avatar fails.

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/pages/AnswerReviewPage.jsx`

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed

---

### 7. Xano Endpoint Updates

**Endpoint:** `GET /review/{token}` (Public API)

**Required Fields Added:**
1. ✅ `pricing_status` - Shows offer status (offer_pending, offer_accepted, offer_declined)
2. ✅ `decline_reason` - Why offer was declined (for asker visibility)
3. ⚠️ `offer_expires_at` - When pending offer expires (for countdown timer)

**Update in Xano:**
```javascript
// Response step
{
  id: question.id,
  title: question.title,
  // ... existing fields ...
  pricing_status: question.pricing_status,
  decline_reason: question.decline_reason,
  offer_expires_at: question.offer_expires_at,  // ← ADD THIS
  // ... rest of response ...
}
```

**Status:** ✅ `pricing_status` and `decline_reason` deployed
**Status:** ⚠️ `offer_expires_at` - **NEEDS VERIFICATION** (did you add this?)

---

## 🎯 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Completed & Deployed:
1. ✅ Tab filtering logic
2. ✅ Clickable pending offer cards
3. ✅ 20% time threshold colors
4. ✅ Pending offer status on asker side
5. ✅ Avatar error handling
6. ✅ Xano `pricing_status` field
7. ✅ Xano `decline_reason` field

### Needs Verification:
1. ⚠️ Xano `offer_expires_at` field - **Please confirm this was added**

If `offer_expires_at` is missing, the countdown timer won't show on asker side (graceful degradation - no error, just no timer displayed).

---

## 🔧 XANO VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

To verify all Xano updates are complete:

### Test `GET /review/{token}`:
```bash
# Use a valid review token from a Deep Dive question
GET https://xlho-4syv-navp.n7e.xano.io/api:BQW1GS7L/review/{token}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 214,
  "title": "Question title",
  "pricing_status": "offer_pending",      // ✅ Should exist
  "decline_reason": null,                 // ✅ Should exist
  "offer_expires_at": 1729800000000,      // ⚠️ Verify this exists
  "sla_hours_snapshot": 48,
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

**If `offer_expires_at` is missing:**
- Countdown timer won't display on asker side
- No error will occur (graceful degradation)
- Asker will still see "Awaiting Expert Review" message

**To add `offer_expires_at` in Xano:**
1. Open `GET /review/{token}` endpoint
2. Find Response step
3. Add: `offer_expires_at: question.offer_expires_at`
