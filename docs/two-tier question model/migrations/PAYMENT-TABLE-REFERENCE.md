## üîç Common Queries

### Get all captured payments
```
Filter: status = "captured"
```

### Get all pending captures (authorized but not captured)
```
Filter: status = "authorized" OR status = "accepted"
```

### Get failed captures needing retry
```
Filter: capture_failed = true AND retry_count < 3
```

### Get all payments for a question
```
Filter: question_id = 118
```

### Get all Deep Dive payments
```
Filter: question_type = "deep_dive"
```

### Get payments by date range
```
Filter: created_at >= 1729500000000 AND created_at <= 1729600000000
```

## üîó Relationships

### Belongs To
- **question** (via question_id)

### Used By
- Retry capture cron job (`/api/cron/retry-captures.js`)
- Payment capture endpoint (`/api/payments/capture`)
- Payment cancellation endpoint (`/api/payments/cancel`)
- Answer submission (auto-captures payment)
- Offer decline (auto-refunds payment)
- SLA enforcement (auto-refunds on miss)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Business Rules

1. **One payment per question** - Each question should have exactly one payment record
2. **Status transitions must follow state machine** - Can't skip states
3. **Timestamps must be sequential** - authorized_at < accepted_at < captured_at
4. **Retry limit is 3** - After 3 failed capture attempts, alert admin
5. **Refunds are final** - Once refunded, cannot be captured
6. **Deep Dive requires acceptance** - accepted_at must be set before capture for deep_dive type

## üìù Migration Notes

When populating this table from existing question data:

- Use existing `payment_intent_id` from question table
- If no `payment_intent_id`, generate: `"migrated_" + question.id`
- Set `authorized_at` to question's `paid_at` or `created_at`
- Set `captured_at` to question's `answered_at` (if answered)
- Set `status` based on question's `pricing_status`:
  - 'completed' ‚Üí 'captured'
  - 'offer_declined', 'offer_expired', 'sla_missed' ‚Üí 'refunded'
  - 'offer_accepted' ‚Üí 'accepted'
  - 'paid' ‚Üí 'authorized'
