### 📝 Review & Feedback Flow

**How Askers Provide Ratings:**
1. Asker receives email with review link: `/r/{playback_token_hash}`
2. Frontend loads answer page via `GET /review/{token}` (no auth required)
3. Asker selects rating (1-5 stars) and writes optional feedback
4. Frontend submits via `POST /review/{token}/feedback`
5. Backend validates: token exists, rating 1-5, feedback not duplicate
6. Answer table updated with `rating`, `feedback_text`, `feedback_at`

**Security:** Token-based access, one-time submission, rating validation

- User authentication (GET /answer)
- Internal API key (digest endpoint)

### Optional Improvements (Post-Launch)

1. ✅ Add rate limiting to track-visit endpoint (Completed October 27, 2025)
2. ✅ Add automated tests for GET /answer (Completed October 27, 2025)
3. Monitor digest endpoint performance in production

---

**Assessment:** ✅ **System is secure and ready for production**

All 48 endpoints are documented, all 48 have been security reviewed, and 23 critical scenarios are covered by automated tests. The system demonstrates comprehensive security coverage across all authentication methods, ownership checks, and payment validation.
