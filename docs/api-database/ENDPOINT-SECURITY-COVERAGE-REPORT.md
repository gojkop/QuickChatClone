## Overall Security Posture

### ✅ Strong Security Coverage

**Documentation:** ✅ 100% (48/48 endpoints documented)
**Security Reviews:** ✅ 100% (48/48 reviewed)
**Automated Tests:** ✅ 23 critical scenarios covered (all passing)

### Security Strengths

1. ✅ **Authentication:** All sensitive endpoints require auth
2. ✅ **Authorization:** Cross-expert ownership checks prevent data leaks
3. ✅ **Payment Security:** Payment reuse prevention, validation in place
4. ✅ **Token Protection:** playback_token_hash never exposed to experts
5. ✅ **Input Validation:** Rating ranges, required fields validated
6. ✅ **Internal Endpoints:** Protected by API key, never exposed publicly

### Outstanding Items

✅ **No outstanding items** - All security issues have been resolved

---

## Recommendation

### For Immediate Production Launch: ✅ READY

**All critical security issues are resolved.**

The 2 recently added endpoints (GET /answer, GET /internal/digest/pending-questions) follow the same security patterns as existing endpoints and are protected by:
- User authentication (GET /answer)
- Internal API key (digest endpoint)

### Optional Improvements (Post-Launch)

1. ✅ Add rate limiting to track-visit endpoint (Completed October 27, 2025)
2. ✅ Add automated tests for GET /answer (Completed October 27, 2025)
3. Monitor digest endpoint performance in production

---

**Assessment:** ✅ **System is secure and ready for production**

All 48 endpoints are documented, all 48 have been security reviewed, and 23 critical scenarios are covered by automated tests. The system demonstrates comprehensive security coverage across all authentication methods, ownership checks, and payment validation.
