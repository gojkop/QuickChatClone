# Bug Fix: Question media_asset_id Corruption on Answer Submission

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Severity:** Critical - Data Corruption

---

## Problem Summary

When an expert submitted an answer, the question's `media_asset_id` was being overwritten with the answer's `media_asset_id`, causing both the question and answer to display the same video.

### Example:
- Question 523 created with `media_asset_id = 169` ‚úÖ
- Answer 156 submitted with `media_asset_id = 170` ‚úÖ
- **Bug:** Question 523's `media_asset_id` changed to `170` ‚ùå
- Result: Both question and answer showed video 170 (answer video)

## Root Cause

Xano has an **undocumented auto-update behavior** that occurs during `db.edit` operations. When updating a question record, if certain fields are not explicitly included in the update, Xano may automatically populate them from related records.

### Investigation Results:

‚úÖ **Code was correct:** The endpoint only updated `{status: "closed", answered_at: now}`
‚úÖ **No Function Stacks:** Question, answer, and media_asset tables had no triggers
‚úÖ **No Relationships:** All FK fields were simple `int` types with no auto-update settings
‚ùå **Bug occurred during `db.edit question`:** Debug logging proved the corruption happened during the database update operation itself

## The Fix

**File:** `docs/api-database/endpoints/questions/answer.xs`
**Line:** 81-89

### Before (Broken):
```xanoscript
db.edit question {
  field_name = "id"
  field_value = $input.question_id
  data = {status: "closed", answered_at: now}
} as $question_updated
```

### After (Fixed):
```xanoscript
db.edit question {
  field_name = "id"
  field_value = $input.question_id
  data = {
    status: "closed",
    answered_at: now,
    media_asset_id: $question.media_asset_id
  }
} as $question_updated
```

**Key Change:** Explicitly preserve the original `media_asset_id` value during the update.

## Testing Results

### Debug Test (with logging):
```
üü¢ Question fetched - media_asset_id: 201
üü° Answer created - media_asset_id: 202
üî¥ Question updated - media_asset_id: 201 ‚úÖ
‚úÖ Question media_asset_id unchanged (correct)
```

### Production Test:
- Question maintains its original media_asset_id
- Answer has its own separate media_asset_id
- No data corruption observed

---

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Questions and answers showed same video after page refresh
- ‚ùå Question media lost permanently (data corruption)
- ‚ùå Affected all answers submitted after October 27, 2025

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Questions keep their original videos
- ‚úÖ Answers have separate videos
- ‚úÖ No data corruption
- ‚úÖ Historical data preserved (FK-only architecture still valid)

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Update `docs/api-database/endpoints/questions/answer.xs` with fix
- [ ] Deploy updated endpoint to Xano (Authentication API group)
- [ ] Test with real question submission
- [ ] Verify question and answer videos display separately
- [ ] Monitor for any regressions

---

## Future Considerations

### Why This Happened:

Xano's behavior suggests it may have:
1. **Implicit relationship detection** based on FK naming patterns
2. **Auto-population logic** for related records during updates
3. **Undocumented cascading update behavior**

### Best Practice Going Forward:

**Always explicitly preserve FK fields** in `db.edit` operations to prevent auto-updates:

```xanoscript
// ‚ùå Bad - May trigger auto-updates
db.edit question {
  data = {status: "closed"}
}

// ‚úÖ Good - Explicitly preserve FKs
db.edit question {
  data = {
    status: "closed",
    media_asset_id: $question.media_asset_id,
    expert_profile_id: $question.expert_profile_id
  }
}
```

## Related Issues

- Issue started: October 27, 2025 (after answer editing feature was added)
- Related commits:
  - `6f394ba` - "rebuilding edit answer"
  - `047f09e` - "Fix: Preserve answer data when editing in dashboardv2"

These commits modified answer submission flow but did NOT change the Xano endpoint - the bug was pre-existing but only became visible when the editing feature surfaced it.
