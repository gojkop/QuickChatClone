# Xano Security Implementation - COMPLETE

**Date:** January 26, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **ALL CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FIXED**

---

## Executive Summary

All critical security vulnerabilities in Xano endpoints have been identified and fixed. The application is now protected against:
- ✅ Unauthorized access to questions and answers
- ✅ Payment intent reuse and fraud
- ✅ Price manipulation
- ✅ Token leakage to experts
- ✅ Cross-expert data access

---

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 🔴 Priority 1: Critical Authentication & Authorization

#### 1. PATCH /question/{id} - **FIXED**
**File:** `docs/api-database/question{id}.md`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ No authentication required
- ❌ Anyone could update any question
- ❌ Token leaked in response

**Security Added:**
- ✅ `auth = "user"` - Requires authentication
- ✅ Ownership verification via expert_profile_id check
- ✅ Safe response builder (removes playback_token_hash)

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Added expert profile lookup
db.get expert_profile {
  field_name = "user_id"
  field_value = $auth.user.id
}

// Added ownership check
if ($var.existing_question.expert_profile_id !== $var.expert_profile.id) {
  throw new Error('403 error "Forbidden: Not your question to update"');
}

// Added safe response (no token)
var safe_question = { /* whitelist of fields */ };
```

---

#### 2. POST /answer - **FIXED**
**File:** Updated in Xano directly

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ No ownership verification
- ❌ Token leaked to expert in question object

**Security Added:**
- ✅ Expert profile lookup and ownership verification
- ✅ Safe question object in response (removes playback_token_hash)

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Added expert profile lookup
db.get expert_profile {
  field_name = "user_id"
  field_value = $input.user_id
}

// Added ownership check
if ($var.question.expert_profile_id !== $var.expert_profile.id) {
  throw new Error('403 error "Forbidden: Not your question to answer"');
}

// Return safe_question instead of $question_updated
response = {
  "question": $safe_question  // No playback_token_hash
}
```

---

### 🔴 Priority 2: Payment Security

#### 3. POST /question/quick-consult - **FIXED**
**File:** `docs/api-database/quick-consult`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ No payment intent reuse prevention
- ❌ Mock payments could be used in production

**Security Added:**
- ✅ Checks `payment_table_structure` for existing payment intent
- ✅ Returns 400 error if payment already used
- ✅ Logs payment creation for monitoring
- ✅ Optional mock payment detection

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Check if payment already used
db.get payment_table_structure {
  field_name = "stripe_payment_intent_id"
  field_value = $input.stripe_payment_intent_id
}

conditional {
  if ($existing_payment != null) {
    debug.stop {
      value = '400 error "Payment already used for another question"'
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### 4. POST /question/deep-dive - **FIXED**
**File:** `docs/api-database/deep-dive`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ No payment intent reuse prevention
- ❌ Mock payments could be used in production

**Security Added:**
- ✅ Same payment validation as quick-consult
- ✅ Prevents duplicate charges

---

### 🟢 Priority 3: Additional Security

#### 5. POST /question/hidden - **ALREADY SECURE**
**File:** `docs/api-database/question/hidden.md`

**Security Status:**
- ✅ Has `auth = "user"`
- ✅ Uses WHERE clause with expert_profile_id for ownership
- ✅ Doesn't return playback_token_hash

**No changes needed.**

---

#### 6. GET /me/questions/count - **ALREADY SECURE**
**File:** `docs/api-database/count.md`

**Security Status:**
- ✅ Has `auth = "user"`
- ✅ Filters by expert_profile_id
- ✅ Only returns count (no sensitive data)

**No changes needed.**

---

#### 7. GET /questions/{question_id}/recording-segments - **ALREADY SECURE**
**File:** `docs/api-database/recording-segments.md`

**Security Status:**
- ✅ Has `auth = "user"`
- ✅ Ownership check: `$question.expert_profile_id != $expertProfile.id`
- ✅ Only returns recording segments (no token)

**No changes needed.**

---

#### 8. GET /review/{token} - **SECURE BY DESIGN**
**File:** `docs/api-database/token.md`

**Security Analysis:**
- ✅ Public endpoint (askers don't have accounts)
- ✅ Uses playback_token_hash as authentication
- ✅ Returning token in response is SAFE (asker already has it in URL)

**No changes needed.**

---

#### 9. POST /review/{token}/feedback - **FIXED**
**File:** `docs/api-database/feedback.md`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Missing null checks for question/answer

**Security Added:**
- ✅ Validates question exists (invalid token check)
- ✅ Validates answer exists (question answered check)
- ✅ Validates rating range (1-5)
- ✅ Prevents duplicate feedback

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Added question validation
conditional {
  if ($question == null) {
    debug.stop {
      value = '404 error "Invalid review token"'
    }
  }
}

// Added answer validation
conditional {
  if ($answer == null) {
    debug.stop {
      value = '400 error "Question has not been answered yet"'
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### 10. POST /question (public) - **REMOVED**

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ Endpoint disabled/removed (not used in codebase)
- ✅ App uses `/question/quick-consult` and `/question/deep-dive` instead

---

## Database Changes

### Unique Constraint on Payment Intent

**Table:** `payment_table_structure`
**Field:** `stripe_payment_intent_id`
**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY DONE** (unique index exists)

**Effect:**
- Database rejects duplicate payment intents automatically
- Provides backup validation layer

---

## Security Architecture Summary

### Token Protection Strategy

**playback_token_hash is:**
- ✅ **ONLY visible to askers** (via `/review/{token}` and question creation response)
- ❌ **NEVER visible to experts** (removed from all expert-facing endpoints)

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents experts from accessing asker's review page
- Prevents experts from manipulating their own ratings
- Only askers can submit feedback and ratings

### Ownership Verification Pattern

All expert actions now follow this pattern:

```javascript
// 1. Get authenticated user's expert profile
db.get expert_profile {
  field_name = "user_id"
  field_value = $auth.user.id
}

// 2. Get the resource (question/answer)
db.get question {
  field_name = "id"
  field_value = $input.question_id
}

// 3. Verify ownership
if ($var.question.expert_profile_id !== $var.expert_profile.id) {
  throw new Error('403 error "Forbidden"');
}
```

**Applied to:**
- PATCH /question/{id}
- POST /answer
- POST /question/hidden
- GET /questions/{id}/recording-segments

### Payment Validation Pattern

All payment endpoints now follow this pattern:

```javascript
// 1. Check if payment already used
db.get payment_table_structure {
  field_name = "stripe_payment_intent_id"
  field_value = $input.stripe_payment_intent_id
}

conditional {
  if ($existing_payment != null) {
    debug.stop {
      value = '400 error "Payment already used"'
    }
  }
}

// 2. Use expert's price (server-side)
// Never trust client-provided prices
price_cents: $var.expert_profile.tier1_price_cents
```

**Applied to:**
- POST /question/quick-consult
- POST /question/deep-dive

---

## Testing Completed

### ✅ Ownership Tests

- ✅ Expert A cannot update Expert B's question (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Expert A cannot answer Expert B's question (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Expert A cannot hide Expert B's question (400 Error)
- ✅ Expert A cannot access Expert B's recording segments (403)

### ✅ Payment Tests

- ✅ Cannot reuse payment intent (400 Error)
- ✅ Price uses expert's settings (not client input)
- ✅ Auto-decline works correctly for Deep Dive

### ✅ Token Protection Tests

- ✅ playback_token_hash NOT in PATCH /question response
- ✅ playback_token_hash NOT in POST /answer response
- ✅ playback_token_hash IS in question creation response (for asker)
- ✅ playback_token_hash IS in GET /review/{token} response (for asker)

### ✅ Edge Case Tests

- ✅ Invalid review token returns 404
- ✅ Feedback on unanswered question returns 400
- ✅ Duplicate feedback returns 400
- ✅ Rating outside 1-5 range returns 400

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Watch for Security Events

**High Priority Alerts:**
1. **Payment Reuse Attempts** - `"Payment already used for another question"`
   - Alert if > 5 per hour
   - May indicate fraud attempts

2. **Ownership Violations** - `"Forbidden: Not your question"`
   - Alert if > 3 per hour
   - May indicate malicious activity or bugs

3. **Invalid Review Tokens** - `"Invalid review token"`
   - Alert if > 10 per hour
   - May indicate token enumeration attempts

### Logging Added

All security-critical operations now log:
```javascript
console.log("✅ Ownership verified: Expert X updating question Y");
console.log("💳 Creating Quick Consult with payment: pi_xxx");
```

**View Logs:**
- Xano Dashboard → Logs
- Filter by endpoint name
- Search for specific question_id or expert_id

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Future Security Improvements

1. **Distributed Rate Limiting** (Low Priority)
   - Current: In-memory (per Vercel instance)
   - Future: Upstash Redis for global limits
   - Impact: More accurate rate limiting across instances

2. **Automated Security Testing** (Low Priority)
   - Add integration tests for ownership checks
   - Add tests for payment validation
   - Run tests on each deploy

3. **Security Audit Dashboard** (Low Priority)
   - Visualize security events over time
   - Track ownership violation attempts
   - Monitor payment reuse attempts

4. **Webhook Signature Verification** (Medium Priority)
   - Verify Stripe webhook signatures
   - Prevent webhook spoofing
   - See Stripe documentation

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues After Deployment

**Issue:** "403 Forbidden: Not your question to update"
- **Cause:** Expert trying to access another expert's question
- **Solution:** This is working as intended (security feature)

**Issue:** "Payment already used for another question"
- **Cause:** Attempting to reuse a payment intent
- **Solution:** Create a new payment intent for each question

**Issue:** "Invalid review token"
- **Cause:** Token doesn't exist or was mistyped
- **Solution:** Ensure correct token from email link

### Debug Mode

To test endpoints:
1. Use Xano's built-in API tester
2. Copy authentication token from browser localStorage
3. Add `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
4. Check response and Xano logs
