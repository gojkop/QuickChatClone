# mindPick - Strategic One-Pager

**Live at:** www.mindpick.me  
**Status:** Production (Beta)

## What is mindPick?

mindPick transforms "Can I pick your brain?" requests into **paid, asynchronous video consultations**. Experts share one personal link where people can ask focused questions via video/audio, receive professional answers on the expert's schedule, and pay fairly for the value received.

**Core Positioning:**  
*Expert-led Q&A marketplace that replaces awkward favors and calendar tetris with structured, compensated knowledge exchange.*

---

## The Problem We Solve

### For Experts
- **Overwhelmed by free consultation requests** ("quick calls" that become 60-minute commitments)
- **Calendar fragmentation** from back-to-back meetings
- **Undervalued expertise** (giving away specialized knowledge for free)
- **Context-switching** (breaking flow state for scheduled calls)

### For Askers
- **Hard to get expert attention** (cold emails ignored, expensive agencies)
- **Scheduling friction** (finding mutual availability across timezones)
- **One-size-fits-all solutions** (generic blog posts, not personalized advice)
- **Unclear pricing** (hourly consulting feels too formal/expensive)

---

## How It Works

### Expert Flow
1. **Set up profile** (handle, price, SLA, specialization)
2. **Share one link** (mindpick.me/u/yourhandle)
3. **Receive questions** (video/audio/text with optional attachments)
4. **Answer when ready** (record video/audio response, up to 15 min)
5. **Get paid** (Stripe deposits earnings, minus platform fee)

### Asker Flow
1. **Find expert** (via shared link or profile browsing)
2. **Record question** (video/audio, up to 90 seconds total)
3. **Pay upfront** (Stripe payment, price set by expert)
4. **Receive answer** (within expert's SLA, typically 24-48h)
5. **Review & rate** (optional feedback loop)

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Platform fees:**
   - Free users: 10% per transaction
   - Pro users: 7% per transaction (€15/month subscription)
   - Pro+ users: 5% per transaction (€49/month) - future tier
   
2. **Subscription tiers:**
   - **Free:** Basic Q&A, generic links
   - **Pro:** Marketing analytics, custom campaigns, priority support
   - **Pro+:** A/B testing, AI features, white-label options (planned)

3. **Optional revenue share:**
   - Charity donation feature (experts can allocate % to causes)

### Unit Economics (Example)
- Expert charges: €100
- Asker pays: €100 (no markup)
- Platform fee (Pro user): €7
- Expert receives: €93
- Stripe fee: ~€3 (absorbed by platform)
- **Net margin:** ~€4 per transaction
