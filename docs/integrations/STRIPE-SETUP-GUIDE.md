**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

---

## 1. Create Stripe Account

### Sign Up

1. Go to https://stripe.com
2. Click "Start now" or "Sign up"
3. Fill in your details:
   - Email address
   - Full name
   - Country (determines available payment methods and currencies)
   - Password

4. Verify your email address

**You now have a Stripe account!** You can start testing immediately in **Test Mode**.

---

## 2. Get Your API Keys

Stripe provides two sets of API keys:
- **Test keys** - For development and testing (start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_`)
- **Live keys** - For production (start with `sk_live_` and `pk_live_`)

### Get Test Keys (For Development)

1. Log in to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Make sure you're in **Test Mode** (toggle in top-right corner should show "Test mode")
3. Go to **Developers** ‚Üí **API keys**
4. You'll see two keys:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...`) - Safe to use in frontend
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`) - Keep this secret, backend only!

5. Click "Reveal test key" to see the secret key
6. Copy both keys to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Backend
STRIPE_ENABLED=true
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51ABCdefgh1234567890...
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_51ABCdefgh1234567890...

# Frontend
VITE_STRIPE_ENABLED=true
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_51ABCdefgh1234567890...
```

### Get Live Keys (For Production)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Live keys require completing business verification first!

1. Complete business verification (see section 3)
2. Toggle to **Live Mode** (top-right corner)
3. Go to **Developers** ‚Üí **API keys**
4. Copy **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_...`)
5. Click "Reveal live key" to see **Secret key** (starts with `sk_live_...`)
6. Add to Vercel environment variables (NEVER commit live keys to git!)

## 4. Configure Payment Settings

### Accepted Payment Methods

By default, Stripe enables **credit and debit cards**. To enable additional methods:

2. Enable additional methods:
   - ‚úÖ **Cards** (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover) - Always enabled
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Apple Pay** - Enable for iOS/Safari users
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Google Pay** - Enable for Android/Chrome users

---

## 5. Configure Radar (Fraud Prevention)

Stripe Radar helps prevent fraudulent payments.

### Basic Configuration (Free)

1. Go to **Radar** ‚Üí **Rules**
2. Default rules are already enabled:
   - Block payments with high risk scores
   - Block payments from countries with high fraud rates
   - Require 3D Secure authentication for risky payments

3. Review and customize rules if needed

### Recommended Rules for QuickChat

```
Block if:
- Risk score > 75
- Card country != Billing country AND Risk score > 50
- Elevated risk from billing country

Allow if:
- Cardholder successfully passed 3D Secure authentication
```

**Custom Rule Example:**
- Block payments from VPN/proxy IP addresses with risk > 60

---

## 6. Configure Email Receipts

Stripe can automatically send email receipts to customers.

### Enable Email Receipts

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Email**
2. Under **Customer emails**, enable:
   - ‚úÖ **Successful payments** - Send receipt on payment success
   - ‚úÖ **Refunds** - Send notification on refunds
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Disputes** - Send notification on chargebacks

3. Customize email template:
   - Add your logo
   - Customize colors
   - Add custom footer text

**Note:** QuickChat already sends custom email notifications via ZeptoMail, so Stripe receipts are optional.

---

## 7. Configure Webhooks (Optional, for Future Use)

Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your server about payment events.

### When You Need Webhooks

- Handling failed payments
- Processing refunds
- Detecting disputes/chargebacks
- Subscription renewals (future feature)

### Setup Webhooks

1. Go to **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Enter your endpoint URL:

   - **Live Mode:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

4. Select events to listen to:
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.canceled`
   - ‚úÖ `charge.refunded`
   - ‚úÖ `charge.dispute.created`

5. Click **Add endpoint**

6. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)

**Example:**
- $50 question = $1.75 fee (you receive $48.25)
- $100 question = $3.20 fee (you receive $96.80)

**Additional fees:**
- International cards: +1.5%
- Currency conversion: +1%
- Disputes: $15 per dispute (refunded if you win)

**No monthly fees, no setup fees, no hidden costs.**

### Optimizing Fees

1. **Encourage domestic cards** - Lower fees
2. **Use Link** - Stripe's one-click checkout (no extra fees)
3. **Set minimum amounts** - $10+ to reduce % impact
4. **Reduce disputes** - Clear policies and good customer service

### Calculate Net Revenue

```javascript
// Gross amount: $100
const grossAmount = 100.00;

// Stripe fee: 2.9% + $0.30
const stripeFee = (grossAmount * 0.029) + 0.30;
// = $3.20

// Net amount you receive
const netAmount = grossAmount - stripeFee;
// = $96.80
```
