              The Starter plan is free to join with a 10% platform fee per transaction. The Pro plan costs â‚¬15/month and reduces the fee to 7%. All transactions are also subject to standard Stripe processing fees, which are paid by the expert.

            <AccordionItem question="How do I get paid?">
              Payments are processed via Stripe Connect. You will connect your bank account securely to Stripe during onboarding. Payouts are handled directly by Stripe and sent to your bank account.

            <AccordionItem question="When will I get my answer?">
              Each expert sets their own Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is clearly displayed on their public page (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours). You are guaranteed to receive a response within that window.
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem question="What if the expert doesn't answer in time?">
              If the expert misses their stated SLA, your payment is automatically refunded in full to your original payment method. No action is needed from you.
